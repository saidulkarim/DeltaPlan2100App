                                In the Fifth Assessment Report of the International Panel for
                                Climate Change (IPCC), the globally averaged combined land and ocean
                                surface temperature data show a warming of 0.85 (0.65 to 1.06) °C,
                                over the period 1880 to 2012. The total increase between the average
                                of the 1850–1900 period and the 2003-2012 period is 0.78 (0.72 to
                                0.85) °C. For the longest period when calculation of regional trends
                                is suﬃciently complete (1901 to 2012), almost the entire globe has
                                experienced surface warming. In addition to robust multi-decadal
                                warming, global mean surface temperature exhibits substantial
                                decadal and inter-annual variability. The pattern of rising global
                                temperatures is expected to continue in the future. Projections show
                                that for 2046-2065, mean temperature rise ranges from 1.0 to 1.4°C,
                                whereas it ranges from 1.0 to 3.7°C for the period 2081-2100.

                                Bangladesh has also experienced considerable rise in temperature.
                                While there is debate about the magnitude of future increase, there
                                is consensus that global warming will increase and so will be the
                                case for Bangladesh. In this Report two scenarios are considered:
                                Business as Usual scenario (BAU) and Extreme scenario (EXT). The BAU
                                considers the moderate climate change scenario with sustained global
                                and national eﬀorts to reduce Green House Gas (GHG) emissions. The
                                EXT considers the extreme climate change scenario with limited
                                global and national eﬀorts to reduce the GHG emissions and fossil
                                fuel based economic development. Projections show that temperature
                                will rise in all regions in Bangladesh in future similar to the
                                global trend. The magnitude ranges from 1.4 to 1.9°C for BAU and
                                around 2°C for EXT by 2050. Further rise in temperature is expected
                                in the latter half of the century, especially in the EXT scenario.

                                The rainfall pattern in Bangladesh is going to be more variable and
                                erratic in future. There is an indication that pre-monsoon and
                                monsoon rainfall will increase under BAU scenario. On an annual
                                basis, the rainfall is expected to increase in most regions during
                                2030. But, during 2050, southern parts of the country along with the
                                eastern hills might get reductions in rainfall. Under the EXT
                                scenario, as temperature rise will be higher, more erratic behavior
                                of rainfall along with variation in amounts is projected.

                                Flood is a recurrent phenomenon of Bangladesh. Three mighty rivers
                                the Ganges, the Brahmaputra and the Meghna meet together in
                                Bangladesh forming the largest delta of the world. As a consequence,
                                most of the country consists of huge ﬂood plain and delta of which,
                                around 70% of the total area is less than one meter above sea level
                                and 10% of the land area is made up of lakes and rivers. Bangladesh
                                experiences heavy monsoon rains, especially over the highlands along
                                with frequent tropical storms in coastal region. All of these events
                                trigger frequent ﬂood occurrence in Bangladesh. On average, an
                                estimated 20-25% of the country becomes inundated due to river
                                spilling and drainage congestion. Extreme situation arises when the
                                three major rivers (the Ganges, the Brahmaputra, and the Meghna)
                                reach their ﬂood peak at a similar time. In general, 55-60% of the
                                country is inundated during extreme ﬂood events. Recent evidence
                                reveals that the magnitude and frequency of mega ﬂoods is increasing
                                as a consequence of climate change. Other human causes like
                                construction of dam in upper riparian countries, unplanned
                                urbanization in illegally encroached ﬂoodplains, lack of combination
                                of structural and non-structural measures, etc. are aggravating the
                                situation. Research suggests that the ﬂood extent will be increased
                                for all areas of the country by mid-century (2050) based on the EXT
                                scenario. Both banks of the Brahmaputra-Jamuna Rivers will be worst
                                aﬀected in this scenario. On average, 3-9% additional area will be
                                inundated from the base (1978-2007) on the left side of the Jamuna
                                River. On the other hand, some portion of the Barind region adjacent
                                to right bank of Jamuna river will be more inundated (around 30%)
                                from the base by 2050 due to ﬂooding in the EXT scenario.

                                The droughts occurring in Bangladesh are not meteorological droughts
                                but agricultural droughts, which could be also termed as severe
                                moisture stress. In the drought prone agro-ecological regions of
                                Bangladesh, period of dry days’ range between 32-48 days, starting
                                from 24 March to 21 May. During this period the temperature also
                                rises more than 40°C for 5 to 15 days within the same
                                agro-ecological regions. In addition, some soils have low moisture
                                holding capacities, which show diﬀerent degrees of doughtiness. The
                                government’s intervention to attack drought with the Barind Region
                                Irrigation Project has changed the proﬁle of the Barind region with
                                a rapid transformation of the area into an agrarian green ﬁeld with
                                a diversiﬁed agriculture based on rice, fruits and vegetables. This
                                has contributed substantially to lowering poverty in the North-West
                                part of Bangladesh. Yet, the drought risk has been shifted forward
                                as surface water reduction from diversion of river water upstream in
                                India and inadequate rainfall in the dry season continues to lower
                                the water table. So, climate change that lowers rainfall further in
                                the dry season could hurt agriculture in the Barind Tract.

                                The morphology of the country’s rivers is highly dynamic and river
                                bank erosion is also a regular phenomenon, particularly along the
                                banks of the main rivers. The present rate of the Jamuna bank
                                erosion is about 1,770 ha per year while bank erosion by Padma River
                                is about 1298 ha per year. Lower Meghna erodes at a rate of 2,900 ha
                                per year. A major reason for the erosion is that the discharge in
                                the rivers is increasing. Flow records over 50 years long for the
                                station Bahadurabad (Brahmaputra/ Jamuna rivers) show that peak
                                discharge is increasing and is peaking earlier. The average timing
                                of the peak was in the middle of August but is now in the ﬁrst week
                                of August. At Bhairab Bazar (Meghna), peak discharge is decreasing
                                and its occurrence is delayed slightly. The time of peak has moved
                                to the last week of September from mid-July in the late 1970s. At
                                Hardinge Bridge station on the Ganges, peak discharge is increasing
                                but the time of peak is advancing. The date is advancing by about
                                one day in a decade. The rising peak discharges of the Ganges and
                                the Brahmaputra mean increasing probability of future river erosion.
                                One consolation is that if the present trend of advancing of the
                                peak prevails, the chances of coincidence of the Ganges and the
                                Brahmaputra peaks will be less, reducing the probability of
                                catastrophic and long duration ﬂoods. Along with erosion, there is
                                also some land accretion from river movements and associated
                                transport of sediments. During 1973-2015, a total of 52,313 ha land
                                has been accreted. On balance land accretion is signiﬁcantly lower
                                than land erosion for all three major rivers, although net erosion
                                is the largest for the Brahmaputra/Jamuna River. Changes in the
                                river ﬂow and sediment transport due to multi-faceted impacts of
                                climate change are expected to increase the dynamics of these rivers
                                even more.

                                geographical position. IPCC (2013) predicts sea level rise from 0.2
                                meter to 1 meter for low to high emission scenarios in 2100 for the
                                Bay of Bengal. Analyses indicate that under EXT scenario ﬂooding
                                extent will increase up to 6% and 8% from base (2005) in central
                                part of Coastal Zone by 2050 and 2100 respectively, which is highest
                                among other parts of the Coastal Zone. The west portion of the
                                Coastal Zone will face 5% and 6% more coastal ﬂooding than base by
                                2050 and 2100 respectively. No signiﬁcant changes have been found in
                                eastern portion of the Coastal Zone.

                                The rising sea level impedes fresh water availability in coastal
                                area, expediting intrusion of salinity front. Both surface water and
                                soil salinity along the coast may be increased with the rising sea
                                level. Projections suggest that in base (2005) condition about 10%
                                area is under 1 ppt salinity and 16% under 5 ppt salinity; these
                                areas will increase up to 17.5% (1 ppt) and 24% (5 ppt) by 2050 in

                                Nearly every year, cyclones hit the country's coastal region and a
                                severe cyclone strikes the country every three years, on average.
                                Intensity of cyclonic storm surges as well as depth and extent of
                                storm surge induced coastal inundation are likely to increase in
                                changing climate through rising sea surface temperature (SST) and
                                sea level. The IPCC further reports that future cyclonic storm
                                surges and related coastal ﬂoods in Bangladesh will likely become
                                more severe as future tropical cyclones increase in intensity. In
                                the EXT scenario, the areas vulnerable to inundation depths of more
                                than 1 meter and 3 meters, respectively would be 14% and 69% higher
                                than the current baseline scenario. A 10-year-return period cyclone
                                in extreme scenario will be more intense by 2050 and cover 43% of
                                the vulnerable area, 17% more than the current coverage.

                                importance to Bangladesh. Impacts on dry and monsoon season ﬂows,

                                The climate change factors working through the geography of the
                                Bangladesh Delta can have vast adverse eﬀects on the country’s
                                development. The climate factors work through a large number of
                                sectors that add up to substantial losses economy wide. The most
                                vulnerable sector is agriculture. High temperature reduces yields of
                                high-yielding varieties of Aus, Aman, and Boro rice. Climate change,
                                especially in temperature, humidity, and radiation, increases the
                                incidence of insect pests, diseases, and microorganisms. Simulation
                                studies predict about 17% decline in overall rice production and as
                                high as 61% decline in wheat production compared with the baseline
                                situation. By 2050, this could lead to a reduction in 4.5 million
                                tonnes of rice output at the 2002 level of production. Agriculture
                                will also suﬀer from increase in soil salinity. The salinity eﬀects
                                are already severe as indicated by very low yields in the salinity
                                prone areas, especially Patuakhali where the average rice yield is
                                40% lower than the national average and more than 50% lower than in
                                Naogaon. Under a moderate climate change scenario, the crop loss due
                                to salinity intrusion could be about 0.2 million tonnes per year.
                                Simulations show that under the BAU scenario, due to the reduction
                                in yield, annual paddy production would fall by 1.60% in 2050 and
                                5.1% in 2100. Agriculture will suﬀer additionally from the higher
                                incidence of ﬂooding caused by climate change, including from
                                inundation caused by sea level rise. The other highly vulnerable
                                sectors are forestry and ecosystems. Many of the anticipated adverse
                                eﬀects of climate change, such as sea level rise, higher
                                temperatures, and an increase in cyclone intensity, will damage the
                                forest resources of the country, put pressure on many
                                climate-sensitive species, and cause increased erosion and
                                deterioration of soil quality in many uplands forested areas. The
                                world’s largest mangrove forest, the Sundarbans, is extremely
                                vulnerable to climate change. Sea level rise will increase saltwater
                                intrusion and negatively aﬀect the forest and its diverse ecosystem.
                                <br/>
                                Additional adverse eﬀects will happen in loss of land and physical
                                assets from inundation. At a one meter SLR, a signiﬁcant part of
                                dryland in Bangladesh will be permanently inundated; the fall in
                                production in all sectors in the economy due to the land quantity
                                shock would lead to a fall in real GDP. Under the BAU scenario, real
                                GDP would fall by 0.73% per year in 2030 and by up to 0.93% per year
                                in 2100. Climate change and the resultant ﬂoods and cyclones will
                                have a signiﬁcant impact on infrastructure in Bangladesh. Estimates
                                suggest that the capital stock in the construction sector would be
                                depleted by 0.05% annually. Additional losses will happen to the
                                road infrastructure. Health hazards will also intensify due to
                                climate change. Water-borne diseases, such as diarrhoea and
                                dysentery, and vector-borne diseases, such as malaria and dengue,
                                are climate sensitive. Projections show growing morbidity could
                                occur from dengue and malaria.
                                <br/>
                                At the macro-level, the combined eﬀects of climate change could
                                range from a loss of 1.1% of GDP per year in a moderate climate
                                change environment to 2.0% of GDP per year in an extreme climate
                                environment. The projections made for BDP 2100 using a moderate
                                climate change environment shows a loss of about 1.1% of GDP per
                                year between 2017-2041 based on the government’s target of achieving
                                9% annual average target. This is a huge negative impact and
                                provides the basis for developing and implementing the Bangladesh
                                Delta Plan. Indeed, if the Delta Plan is implemented along with
                                suggested investment programmes, the Policy Scenario shows that the
                                average growth rate can accelerate to 8.8% of GDP, which yields an
                                average annual GDP gap of 1.9% between the BAU and the Policy
                                Scenario. The value of the Delta Plan for Bangladesh is indeed very
                                high.
                                <br/>
                                In terms of loss of human welfare, district and sub-district level
                                analysis shows that there is a strong positive correlation between
                                incidence of poverty and the intensity of natural hazards. Some 70%
                                of the 16 districts ranked as most exposed to natural disasters
                                (intense risk category with ranking of 1) also show poverty rates
                                that are higher than the national average using the upper poverty
                                line for 2010. There is a similar high positive correlation between
                                high-risk districts (risk ranking of 2) and poverty. Some 67% of
                                these districts have poverty rates that are higher than the national
                                average and 13% have poverty rates same as the national average. At
                                the national level, of the 15 most poverty-stricken districts,
                                almost 90% of the districts belong to natural hazard risk categories
                                1 or 2. Regarding per capita income, some 80% of the most-intense
                                hazard-prone districts (risk ratings of 1) had per capita income
                                below the national average. The corresponding percentages were: 67%
                                for districts in risk category 2 and 100% for risk category 3.
